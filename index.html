        <p class="text">My name is Rory and I'm from Uxbridge Massachusetts. I am currently attending Stonehill College as a Junior Computer Science Major with an Economics Minor. My anticipated graduation date is May 2025. I am very passionate about everything that has to do with Computer Science. I am the treasurer of Stonehill’s student chapter of the ACM and a registered member with the national ACM organization. I have completed a couple personal projects with one of those being this website! This website was part of a challenge run by the Stonehill ACM club to make our own personal website. My most recent work experience is as an IT Intern working for Abcaus Health Solutions in Cranston, RI. </p>
        <p class="text">Outside of Computer science, I am in love with all thing’s fitness. Weightlifting, running, hiking, you name it, I love doing it! I am especially passionate about weightlifting. As I’m passionate about fitness I’m always on the lookout for new healthy recipes to try out, so if you got some good ones let me know! I’m also a die-hard New England Patriots fan, I’ve never been the same since Tom Brady left, but Go Pats! Another one of my favorite hobbies is fishing, I love all types of fishing but my favorite is freshwater bass fishing. There is nothing better than bass fishing on a late summer afternoon. My go to tackle is a black and light blue rubber worm, it never fails me!</p>
